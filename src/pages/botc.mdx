## Good Morning, Ravenswood Bluff...

During a hellish thunderstorm, a scream echoes through the sleepy town of Ravenswood Bluff. The townsfolk rush to investigate and find the beloved local storyteller has been murdered, their body hanging limp from the clocktower. As blood drips onto the cobblestones below, a realisation slowly dawnsâ€¦ a demon has been unleashed, killing by night and taking on human form by day.

Can good find the demon in time? Or will evil overrun this once peaceful town?

## Huh?

Sam and Hamilton are planning to host regular games of [Blood on the Clocktower](https://bloodontheclocktower.com/) throughout the fall and winter.

If you're reading this, then you were probably invited to consider joining us! Congratulations, you VIP.

We thought it would be helpful to provide some context so that you know what you might be getting yourself into... ðŸ˜ˆ

## What's Blood on the Clocktower?

Blood on the Clocktower (BotC) is a **social deduction** game that's played in-person. From the [official website](https://bloodontheclocktower.com/), it's a _game of murder and mystery, lies and logic, deduction and deception for five-to-twenty courageous players and one devious storyteller_.

Games take place in the fictional town of Ravenswood Bluff, where the good townspeople have to work together to find and execute the demon before the demon and their minions manage to eliminate the townspeople.

If you ever played [Mafia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)>) at summer camp like Hamilton did, it's similar! (You may also know it as [Ultimate Werewolf](https://beziergames.com/products/one-night-ultimate-werewolf), its most recent re-branding.)

But in contrast to the limited good/bad roles of Mafia, Blood on the Clocktower features 99 different roles with unique abilities. These abilities make it more fun and strategic for the townspeople to cooperate as they work together to find and eliminate the demon. But look out! The demon and minions also have interesting abilities that help them sow seeds of doubt and chaos among the townspeople.

Blood on the Clocktower also tries to keep dead players more engaged than Mafia did. In Mafia, there wasn't much to do once you died, other than wait for the next round to start. In BotC, dead players get a "ghost vote" that lets them potentially turn the tide during an important execution. You may also find that your fellow players trust you more once you're dead, meaning you learn potentially crucial information for your team!

## Is It A Good Game?

As far as we can tell! It's literally the #1 party game on BoardGameGeek ([link](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/240980/blood-on-the-clocktower)). And there are many people online who claim that their gaming groups have fallen in love with the game, enjoyed some truly incredible social moments together, etc.

Sam and Ham recently played two games in-person, and it was fun! But though one could certainly play Blood on the Clocktower casually and occasionally, it seems to lead to the most rewarding, engaging experiences when played with a fairly consistent group of people who are willing to learn the roles and lean into the shared experience.

As the shorter, darker days of fall and winter approach, we thought that a regular Blood on the Clocktower game would be a great thing! But only if it seems like we could pretty regularly round up a group of 8-12 people to play.

## Where Can I Learn More?

Great question! We would suggest:

- Watching the 10min [How to Play video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-aZP47Nm9g) from the makers of the game.
- Checking out this 23min [review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImcG8sC7qT4), which goes into more detail about the experience.
- Enjoying a (2hr 14min) [full game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m14N28Lq-jM)! (We like this channel's approach to filming games, so if you arrive and find Storyteller Hamilton channeling his inner "Tom," you'll know where he got it from.) We recommend this particular video because it uses the least complex set of characters, which we would probably stick with for a while as we all got to know the roles (and each other's play styles) better.

## I'm In! When Are We Doing This?

That's what we're trying to figure out! We're eyeing **November 1** for our first game.
