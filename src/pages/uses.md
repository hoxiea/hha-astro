title: What I Use
---

After playing with computers for almost 30 years, I'm finally approaching a setup that I love. I thought it would be fun to document it here, in case anyone is curious about what I use to get things done. (Who doesn't love a good [uses](https://uses.tech/) page?)

## The Desk Setup (TODO: picture coming soon)

After about a decade of using a Mac Mini to avoid/boycott Apple laptop keyboards, I finally picked up a ([refurbished](https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro)) **Macbook Pro 16" with an M2 Max, 32GB RAM, and 1TB SSD** in late 2023. What a great machine! It spends a fair amount of time in clamshell mode, safely tucked into a Twelve South [BookArc stand](https://a.co/d/77WKi1e), but I love being able to use it around the house or sit outside with it when the weather is nice.

A big reason I splurged on the M2 Max was its ability to drive three 4K monitors:

- Center: **27" Dell P2715Q 4K**. Going strong since 2017!
- Left: **27" LG UN850-W 4K**. Comparable to the Dell in quality.
- Right: **27" 4K Samsung ???**. My partner's company sent her two of these for remote work, and despite looking like a potato compared to the other two, it does give me more pixels to work with ü§∑üèª

I use a [VIVO dual monitor arm mount](https://a.co/d/eW3mOxr) to keep the two good monitors off my desk and make it easy to adjust the height of the center screen when I'm standing or sitting with my [Jarvis standing desk](https://www.fully.com/jarvis-adjustable-height-desk.html) and its **IKEA butcher block** top.

That **Logitech C920 webcam** atop the center monitor captures audio and video for all my [tutoring](/tutor) and [Focusmate](https://app.focusmate.com/user/hamilton) sessions. (I also have a [Blue Yeti](https://a.co/d/fCsRZ0Y), but the C920 is usually good enough for my humble needs.)

My usual keyboard is a [Kinesis](https://kinesis-ergo.com/) Advantage keyboard, a birthday present to myself in 2012. (Fun fact: I've used the [Dvorak keyboard layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) since 2010.) I also have an [Apple Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK2A3LL/A/magic-keyboard-us-english) that's occasionally the right tool for the job.

I try to use the keyboard as much as possible, but I'm far from being mouse-free. I always have a [Kensington Expert Mouse](https://www.kensington.com/p/products/input-devices/trackballs/expert-mouse-wired-trackball/) to the left of my keyboard, which has worked well since 2022. (When I was struggling with neck/shoulder pain while computing, it was on my right side, so I mouse with my non-dominant hand.) I usually have an [XP Pen](https://www.xp-pen.com/) graphics tablet to the right, too - the original use case was [tutoring](/tutor), but it's also nice for drawing diagrams and even occasionally for regular mouse use.

For computer audio, I use standard [Apple wired headphones](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MNHF2AM/A/earpods-35mm-headphone-plug?fnode=716fb08e675f2d1a3a4683ee8048f40306e73c9b2e71ac5f484198930da571df6bbe2d51555763ae7b9edf5adf26bf80561d5244d4be9f3b5bdae1aa6ee69b84735ac5f43930da5b37b8bb4762a958c44c8eeb288afaa3671ce5eb0663fa3aa79f7b455ee866610baf8e1df1a2468b6e3b70a34f3e8009d3a74f02ef95c39981&fs=fh%3D47d1%252B45a8). Something wireless would be nice, but I've never seen anything wireless that could handle 11 hours straight of tutoring with 100% reliability. (If I had a nickel for every time a student was fumbling with their wireless audio settings, I'd have a lot of nickels.)

Tying this all together is a [CalDigit TS3 Plus dock](https://a.co/d/5tBomdA). It wasn't cheap, but the ability to make all this work with just two cables is worth it. I also have an [Anker USB 3.0 hub](https://a.co/d/3zOG96r) for extra USB ports that are easily accessed - occasionally I need to unplug and replug something to get it working again, and it's nice to make that easy.

I try to stand when I can, but for deep work, sitting is better. I've been using a [Steelcase Leap](https://store.steelcase.com/leap) chair since about 2010 - they had them in a conference room in the Berkeley Statistics department, and I liked the way they felt. (I tried an [Aeron](https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chair/) at one point, but it didn't work for me.)

## Other Tech Hardware

I'm not a huge Apple fanboy or anything, but they do make nice things that work well and work well together...

My personal phone is an **iPhone 13 Pro Max**. I don't use my phone much, so I rocked an iPhone SE for years. But when it was time for something new late 2023, I splurged and it's nice! The camera is üôå and the screen is ü§©. I was worried about missing the home button, but after about four seconds of swiping to do things, it feels natural. (My work phone, in contrast, is an **iPhone 8**. If it can confirm [tutoring](/tutor) session requests and send occasional Apple messages, then it's good enough.)

I have a fairly recent **45mm Apple Watch**. Who knew being able to easily start timers would be so useful? Working out with the StrongLifts watch app is nice, too.

My 1st gen **AirPod Pros** constantly impress me - the noise cancellation is great, and the sound quality is excellent. I'm also impressed, I suppose, that my ancient **iPad mini 2** still powers on and even works pretty well for ebooks.
