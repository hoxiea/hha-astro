  <h1 class="text-4xl">Hey there! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
  <p>
    I help students at top schools across the country succeed in quantitative
    situations as a private tutor.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm also an occasional recreational mathematician with 2.4 degrees in
    Statistics, a programmer, and a fitness enthusiast, among other things. I
    hope to one day create the best Calculus course in the world.
