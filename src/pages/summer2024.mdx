I hope you and your family had a great summer too! üòé

## Travel and Hosting üèîÔ∏è

During June and early July, we were busy hosting guests and traveling.

### A Family Friend Visits Spokane

A longtime family friend was visiting Washington and stayed with us for a few days. We squeezed in a couple great local hikes, including a favorite: [Mount Kit Carson](https://www.alltrails.com/ar/trail/us/washington/mount-kit-carson-trail), near Mount Spokane.

### My Parents in Spokane and Nelson

In mid-June, my parents came out to visit. We drove up to Nelson, British Columbia, where we hiked, explored the area, and destroyed some NYTimes games. We didn't find any wild native orchids, but we did find a bunch of other cool plants!

### Clear Lake and Seattle

In late June, we drove across Washington to spend a week at Clear Lake with our good friends. We hiked, kayaked, paddleboarded, watched movies, read books, and enjoyed nightly feasts prepared by Sam and Ande, both excellent chefs.

Sam and I drove over to Seattle, a new city for me! We started at Pike's Place Market, had some killer Thai food on our way to the Museum of Pop Culture and the Space Needle, and grabbed some tasty French pastries on our way out of town.

### Sam's Sister Visits Spokane

Sam's sister Jessy came to visit us in early July. We had a blast celebrating the Fourth of July at Lake Coeur D'Alene with friends, kayaked and swam at Sandpoint, and hiked another one of our favorite local trails: [Iller Creek](https://www.alltrails.com/ar/trail/us/washington/iller-creek-conservation-area-trail).

## Top Summer Reads üìö

- _Best Fiction_: [Remarkably Bright Creatures](https://a.co/d/0VQd216). Sam read this with her book club, and I tore through it. For what it is, it's great.
- _Best Non-Fiction_: [Courage Is Calling](https://a.co/d/6L0WRbW). I've admired the ideas of Stoicism for a while now, and this was a nice little book about the cardinal virtue of Courage. Great to read between sets while lifting weights!
- _Best Cookbook_: [The Art of Simple Food](https://a.co/d/84mvHOq). Sam and I cook most of our own food, and this book appeals to my desire to understand things from first principles. Next stop on that journey: [Salt Fat Acid Heat](https://a.co/d/2ojRlja)!

## Top Summer Shows üì∫

### The Sopranos

After occasionally discussing paper ideas for a course about the Mafia with a college student last semester, Sam and I were inspired to watch _The Sopranos_, which we had never seen and which often tops Best Shows Ever lists.

I'm hardly a television scholar. (My parents paid me to not-watch TV when I was a kid, and the habit mostly stuck!) But from what I've read, _The Sopranos_ was the crucible in which the modern [Golden Age of Television](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Television_(2000s%E2%80%93present)>) was forged. Though I haven't seen many "Golden Age" shows either, it was evident watching _The Sopranos_ unfold that the writers and producers were actively figuring out how to build compelling character arcs with complex characters, how to pace seasons and what makes good season finales, etc.

It's aged pretty well, all things considered, though I think I feel the same way about _The Sopranos_ as I do about The Beatles: I'm glad it happened, but the formula has been refined in the decades since. (And we just started _Breaking Bad_, so we're seeing the refinement in action!)

### House of the Dragon

I never expect _Dragon_ to be as good as _Game of Thrones_, but I'll tune in when new episodes drop every few years. There were some solid episodes this season - beautiful cinematography, interesting George R.R. Martin twists, and dragons! It felt like the season finale should have been the penultimate episode, though... I guess we'll see what actually happens in a few more years?

### The Bear

The surprise hit of the summer was _The Bear_. I had never heard of it, but wow, the first two seasons were great! Highly recommended. (Season 3 was a huge disappointment - I hope Season 4 arrives soon and brings it back ü§û)

## Building Websites üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

After helping a student last semester with a college-level Web Systems course, I kept the momentum going by building a few websites this summer. (You're looking at one of them - I rebuilt my own website from scratch!)

I won't bore you with the technical details, but you can read more about the finished sites at my [Projects](/projects) page if you're curious.

## Learning üß†

I love to learn, and I often use summer vacations as a chance to learn new things. In addition to everything above, I also:

- Reviewed **Financial Accounting** and **Macroeconomics**, getting ready to help students taking these courses in the fall.

- Started learning the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language. Seems like a really well-designed language - I'd love a chance to use it for a project!

- Built a deck. Or rather, helped our neighbors rebuild their deck. I love improving my surroundings in physical, tangible visible ways (in contrast to pushing bytes around at a desk), and I learned some good construction skills on this project. Excited for the hot tub coming soon!
