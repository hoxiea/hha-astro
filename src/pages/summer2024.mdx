Happy August! As the summer draws to a close and the new school year approaches, I thought it would be fun to share some highlights from the past few months with you.

I hope you and your family had a great summer too! 😎

## Travel and Hosting 🏔️

During June and early July, we were busy hosting guests and traveling.

### A Family Friend Visits Spokane

A longtime family friend was visiting Washington and stayed with us for a few days. We squeezed in a couple great local hikes, including a favorite: [Mount Kit Carson](https://www.alltrails.com/ar/trail/us/washington/mount-kit-carson-trail), near Mount Spokane.

### My Parents in Spokane and Nelson

In mid-June, my parents came out to visit. We drove up to Nelson, British Columbia, where we hiked, explored the area, and destroyed some NYTimes games. We didn't find any wild native orchids, but we did find a bunch of other cool plants!

### Clear Lake and Seattle

In late June, we drove across Washington to spend a week at Clear Lake with our good friends. We hiked, kayaked, paddleboarded, watched movies, read books, and enjoyed nightly feasts prepared by Sam and Ande, both excellent chefs.

Sam and I drove over to Seattle, a new city for me! We started at Pike's Place Market, had some killer Thai food on our way to the Museum of Pop Culture and the Space Needle, and grabbed some tasty French pastries on our way out of town.

### Sam's Sister Visits Spokane

Sam's sister Jessy came to visit us in early July. We had a blast celebrating the Fourth of July at Lake Coeur D'Alene with friends, kayaked and swam at Sandpoint, and hiked another one of our favorite local trails: [Iller Creek](https://www.alltrails.com/ar/trail/us/washington/iller-creek-conservation-area-trail).

## Top Picks 📚 📺 💪

- _Best Fiction_: [Remarkably Bright Creatures](https://a.co/d/0VQd216). Sam read this with her book club, and I tore through it. For what it is, it's great.
- _Best Non-Fiction_: [The Daily Stoic](https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Stoic-Meditations-Wisdom-Perseverance/dp/0735211736/). I've admired the ideas of Stoicism for a while now (I apparently bought this in 2017), but this summer I started spending a few minutes each morning reflecting on the daily thoughts in this book, and I found that it was a really nice addition to my morning routine.
- _Best Cookbook_: [The Art of Simple Food](https://a.co/d/84mvHOq). Sam and I cook most of our own food, and this book appeals to my desire to understand things from first principles. Next stop on that journey: [Salt Fat Acid Heat](https://a.co/d/2ojRlja)!
- _Best TV Show_: [The Bear](https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/the-bear). The first two seasons were some of the best content I've seen in a long time. Highly recommended!
- _Best Home Gym Addition_: [The Bikeerg](https://www.concept2.com/ergs/bikeerg). I've loved Concept2 equipment since I rowed in Boston, and their bike has nicely complemented our barbell training. In May, I knocked out my first 100,000m ride (about 62 miles) in just under 4 hours, and I'm only getting fitter as I ride 2-3 times per week.

## Building Websites 👨🏻‍💻

After helping a student last semester with a college-level Web Systems course, I kept the momentum going by building a few websites this summer. (You're looking at one of them - I rebuilt my own website from scratch!)

I won't bore you with the technical details, but you can read more about the finished sites at my [Projects](/projects) page if you're curious.

## Learning 🧠

I love to learn, and I often use summer vacations as a chance to learn new things. In addition to everything above, I also:

- Reviewed **Financial Accounting** and **Macroeconomics**, getting ready to help students taking these courses in the fall.

- Started learning the **Rust** programming language. Seems like a really thoughtfully designed language - I'd love a chance to use it for a project!

- Built a deck. Or rather, helped our neighbors rebuild their deck. I love improving my surroundings in physical, tangible visible ways (a nice complement to pushing bytes around at a desk), and I learned some good construction skills on this project. Excited for the hot tub coming soon!

## Closing Thoughts 🏫

It's been a lovely few months, and summer's not even over yet! Events still on the calendar include:

- A morning volunteering with Habitat For Humanity 👷‍♀️👷🏻‍♂️
- Another lake day with friends at Lake Coeur D'Alene 🛥️
- Summer movie night downtown 📽️

But I did my first "Pine Crest summer math packet" tutoring session last week, which can only mean one thing: **another productive academic year lies ahead.**

If you're reading this update, we've probably worked together before. Good news! I'll be helping students succeed again this year. And I'd love to hear about how your summer went, any upcoming academic situations, how you're feeling about them, and how you think I might be able to help - feel free to message me or use [my scheduling website](https://appt.link/hamilton) to grab a 30-Minute Consultation at a convenient time.

And if we've never worked together before, then I'll briefly mention that I've spent 17 years helping students succeed in elite academic situations. [My own education](/education) centered around Mathematics/Statistics and Computer Science at some of the best schools in the world. That training has allowed me to help students succeed in a [wide variety of academic situations](/tutor). And though I expect to be busy this year, if my services might be relevant to your situation, I'd love to learn more - please feel free to [request a 30-Minute Consultation](https://appt.link/hamilton/30min/) so that we can discuss your situation.

<p class="text-xl text-center">To your success in the coming year!</p>
