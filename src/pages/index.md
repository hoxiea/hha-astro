I help students at top schools across the country succeed in quantitative situations as a [private tutor](/tutor).

I'm also an occasional recreational mathematician who has [2.4 degrees in Statistics](/education), a programmer, and a fitness enthusiast, among other things.

Curious about what I use to get it done? Check out my [uses](/uses) page!
