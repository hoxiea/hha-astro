### My Tutoring Timeline

#### 2007 - 2009: Boston

During my last two years at Boston University, I worked with individuals and small groups of struggling Statistics students at BU's Educational Resource Center. I discovered that teaching students who were struggling with the material was a great way to reinforce and enhance my own understanding of the material, plus it was fun!

#### 2010 - 2012: Berkeley

I learned the hard way that a PhD stipend doesn't get you very far in the Bay Area, so I worked one-on-one with undergrads during the two years I spent as a Berkeley grad student.

I was also a Teaching Assistant for ~50 undergraduates preparing to apply to the [Haas School of Business](https://haas.berkeley.edu/). (Interestingly, this number grew to ~70 over the course of the semester as students assigned to other sections started unofficially attending my discussions and office hours instead.)

#### 2013 - 2020: South Florida + Online

In 2013, a former teacher at Pine Crest asked me if I would be willing to help Catherine, a busy student-athlete with Calculus AB. She finished both semesters with an A+ average and confidently earned a 5 on her AP exam. Word spread, and I started helping more students in South Florida.

I also continued working with Catherine, now a busy college student, by developing a remote tutoring workflow that I have been refining ever since.

#### 2020 - Today: Online

In 2020, I was getting burnt out dealing with South Florida traffic and the associated scheduling headaches. That same year, a certain global pandemic meant that nobody wanted me sitting at their dining room table after traveling all over town, so I transitioned to 100% online tutoring. My students and I absolutely love the flexibility, convenience, and improved tutoring experience that it provides.

That brings us to today, where **I help busy, success-oriented students across the country succeed with their technical coursework.**
