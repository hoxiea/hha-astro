title: What I Use
---

My computing setup has come a long way since the early 90s. I thought it would be fun to document the current setup here - who doesn't love a good [uses](https://uses.tech/) page?

## The Desk

After a decade of using Mac Minis to avoid Apple laptop keyboards, I picked up a **Macbook Pro 16" (M2 Max, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD)** in late 2023. Great machine! It mostly lives in clamshell mode, tucked into a Twelve South [BookArc stand](https://a.co/d/77WKi1e), but I love being able to use it around the house and outside when the weather is nice.

A big reason for the M2 Max was its ability to drive three 4K monitors:

- Center: **27" Dell P2715Q**. Going strong since 2017!
- Left: **27" LG UN850-W**. Comparable to the Dell in quality.
- Right: **27" Samsung Whatever**. My partner's employer sent her two of these for remote work, and despite looking like a potato compared to the other two, it does give me more pixels to work with ü§∑üèª

A [VIVO dual monitor arm mount](https://a.co/d/eW3mOxr) keeps the two good monitors off my desk and makes it easy to adjust the height of the center screen when I'm standing or sitting with my [Jarvis standing desk](https://www.fully.com/jarvis-adjustable-height-desk.html). And that **Logitech C920 webcam** atop the center monitor captures audio and video for my tutoring and Focusmate sessions.

My usual keyboard is a [Kinesis](https://kinesis-ergo.com/) Advantage keyboard, a birthday present to myself in 2012. (Fun fact: I've used the [Dvorak keyboard layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) since 2010.) I also have an [Apple Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK2A3LL/A/magic-keyboard-us-english) that's occasionally the right tool for the job.

My workflow is keyboard-optimized, but I'm not mouse-free. I have a [Kensington Expert Mouse](https://a.co/d/cO7DR0p) to the left of my keyboard, the latest in a long line of ergonomic experiments. I often have an [XP Pen](https://www.xp-pen.com/) graphics tablet to the right, too: the cornerstone of tutoring, but it's also great for thinking through technical challenges.

For audio output, I use basic [Apple wired headphones](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MNHF2AM/A/earpods-35mm-headphone-plug?fnode=716fb08e675f2d1a3a4683ee8048f40306e73c9b2e71ac5f484198930da571df6bbe2d51555763ae7b9edf5adf26bf80561d5244d4be9f3b5bdae1aa6ee69b84735ac5f43930da5b37b8bb4762a958c44c8eeb288afaa3671ce5eb0663fa3aa79f7b455ee866610baf8e1df1a2468b6e3b70a34f3e8009d3a74f02ef95c39981&fs=fh%3D47d1%252B45a8). Something wireless would be nice, but I've never seen something wireless that could handle 11 straight hours of tutoring with 100% reliability. (If I had a nickel for every time a student had to fumble around with wireless audio settings, I'd have a lot of nickels üí∞)

Tying it all together is a [CalDigit TS3 Plus dock](https://a.co/d/5tBomdA). It wasn't cheap, but the ability to make all this work with just two cables going into my computer is so nice. And the [Anker USB 3.0 hub](https://a.co/d/3zOG96r) provides easily-reached USB ports - occasionally I need to unplug and replug something to get it working again.

I try to stand when I can, but for deep work, I prefer to sit. I've been using a [Steelcase Leap](https://store.steelcase.com/leap) chair since about 2010 - they had them in a meeting room in the Berkeley Statistics department, and I liked the way they felt.

## Other Tech Hardware

I'm not a huge Apple fanboy or anything, but they do make nice things that work well and work well together...

My personal phone is an **iPhone 13 Pro Max**. I'm not a heavy phone user, so I rocked an iPhone SE for years. But when it was time for something new late 2023, I splurged and it's nice! The camera is üôå and the screen is ü§©. I was worried about missing the home button, but after about four seconds of swiping to do things, it feels natural. (My work phone, in contrast, is an **iPhone 8**. If it can confirm tutoring session requests and send occasional Apple messages, then it's good enough.)

I have a fairly recent **45mm Apple Watch**. (Who knew that having timers on your wrist would be a killer app?) The StrongLifts watch app is nice, too.

My 1st gen **AirPod Pros** constantly impress me - the noise cancellation is great, and the sound quality is excellent. I'm also impressed, I suppose, that my ancient **iPad mini 2** still powers on and even works pretty well for ebooks.
