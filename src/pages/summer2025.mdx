## Travel üèîÔ∏è

Sam and I took a couple of fun trips this summer! It's amazing how many beautiful places are within driving distance of Spokane...

### Olympic National Park

In July, we spent almost a week exploring Olympic National Park with our neighbors. The house we rented was right on the Puget Sound, with some gorgeous paddling opportunities in our backyard.

We went on a few great hikes while we were there too.

### Leavenworth

To celebrate my birthday in late July, we spent a few days in [Leavenworth](https://leavenworth.org/), a Bavarian village in the middle of Washington. In addition to finding some stunning paddleboarding at Lake Wenatchee (that pic at the top), we made the trek to [Colchuck Lake](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/colchuck-lake-via-stuart-lake-trail), a gorgeous alpine lake beneath snowy peaks.

There are still so many places in the northwest we'd like to explore: Yellowstone, Glacier, Banff, and more! But we're slowly checking things off our list, and we had a lot of fun on these trips.

## Top Picks üìö üì∫

- _Best "New" Recipe_: [Pizza Chicken](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1017910-skillet-chicken-with-tomatoes-pancetta-and-mozzarella). Sam loves to cook, and NYT Cooking is a favorite recipe source. This 5-star gem from Melissa Clark comes together quickly in our huge cast iron skillet, and the flavor is unreal. (I say "New" because my dad used to make this when we were kids! Sam wanted to breathe new life into it, and I'm so glad she did.)
- _Best TV Show_: [The Pitt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pitt), hands down. So well-done, so intense. I won't say anything else -- just go watch it if you haven't seen it.
- _Best Non-Fiction Book_: [Built to Move](https://a.co/d/8IPSGiq), by Kelly and Juliet Starrett. KStar taught me much of what I know about mobility work and athletic performance many years ago; _Built to Move_ improved our daily habits for feeling good and performing well. My neck/shoulders feel great after adding his suggestions to our evening stretching routine.
- _Best Fiction Book_: [The Mistborn Trilogy](https://a.co/d/4s8HVgP). At some point, mentions of author Brandon Sanderson hit critical mass and I felt like I had to read something of his. _Mistborn_ is a suggested entry point into his world, and it was a great fantasy story! (And the audiobook, which featured music, sound effects, and many voice actors, really brought it to life.)

## Learning üß†

My most interesting topic of study this summer was Gilbert Strang's [Linear Algebra course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/). Professor Strang taught at MIT for 60+ years, during which he essentially redefined how the subject is taught. Though I took Linear Algebra as an undergraduate and even tutored it last semester, I've learned so much watching his lectures, working through the problem sets, and even taking the exams under testing conditions. What a masterclass in mathematical pedagogy!

## Closing Thoughts üè´

Whether your semester has already begun or you're counting down your final days of summer, another school year approaches. And I'd love to help make it your most successful year yet.

If we've worked together in the past, then you probably know that I'd love to hear about your summer and any upcoming academic pursuits that I might be able to help you with. Feel free to message me or use [my scheduling website](https://appt.link/hamilton) to grab a 30-Minute Consultation or your first session of the semester!

And if we've never worked together before, then I'll briefly mention that I've spent 18 years helping students succeed in elite academic situations. [My own education](/education) involved Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science in some of the world's top programs. That training has allowed me to help students succeed in a [wide variety of academic situations](/tutor). And though I expect to be busy this year, I'd love to learn more about your situation if my services might be relevant -- please feel free to [request](https://appt.link/hamilton/30min/) a 30-Minute Consultation so that we can decide how to proceed.

<p class="text-xl text-center">To your success in the coming year!</p>
