title: "About Me"
---

I was born at a young age in Lowell, MA. Quite the jet-setter, I moved to Miami Beach at age 1 and then to Fort Lauderdale at age 2. Pleased with the balmy weather and my proximity to the Las Olas beach, I settled down for the long haul.

Year Three of my life is a mystery. But when I was four, I enrolled at [Pine Crest](https://www.pinecrest.edu/), where I spent the next 14 years surrounded by smart friends, dedicated teachers, and abundant opportunities to develop great work habits and communication skills.

In fourth grade, my friends joined the school band without telling me. Fast forward two weeks and all the cool instruments were taken - I had to choose between the trombone, French horn, and tuba. While weighing my options, my father leaned over and whispered, ‚ÄúPick the slidey one!‚Äù With that nugget of wisdow, my trombone career was born.

Over the next nine years, I was fortunate enough to perform in a variety of extraordinary settings:
[New England Music Camp](https://snowpond.org/nemc/),
[Interlochen](http://www.interlochen.org/),
the [Florida Youth Orchestra](https://www.floridayouthorchestra.org/) and its Top Brass ensemble,
the Ars Flores Chamber Orchestra,
the Sunrise Symphonic Pops Orchestra,
Florida All-State concert and jazz bands,
and Pine Crest concert bands, jazz bands, and pit orchestras.
Notable conductors I performed with include
[Frederick Fennell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Fennell),
[James Judd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Judd), and
[Thomas Sleeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sleeper).
And yes, <a href="images/carnegie.jpeg" target="_blank">I made it to Carnegie Hall</a>! How? Practice! (And belong to the Florida Youth Orchestra in 2003.)

I graduated from Pine Crest in 2005 and accepted a full, merit-based [Trustee Scholarship](https://www.bu.edu/admissions/tuition-aid/scholarships-financial-aid/first-year-merit/trustee/) from [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/). After exploring Chemistry, Biology, Nutrition, Economics, and Computer Science, I took a Statistics course and liked the intersection of mathematical thinking and computer programming. I completed the combined [BA/MA degree program](https://www.bu.edu/stat/undergraduate-program-information/bama-in-statistics/) in Mathematics/Statistics, graduating Phi Beta Kappa after four years at age 21. I was graciously awarded the College Prize for Excellence in Statistics by the mathematics department faculty, and even gave the student speech at the department graduation ceremony.

After working for a year as a statistical geneticist and R programmer at [Biogen Idec](https://www.biogen.com/), I headed west to start a PhD in the [Statistics department](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/) at [UC Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/index.html) in 2010. I completed two years of coursework before deciding that a PhD in Statistics wasn't for me, as much as I liked Northern California.

In 2012, I moved back to South Florida to figure out what _was_ for me. I started exploring my growing interest in Computer Science while still at Berkeley, an interest I expanded by taking online courses from some of the best professors/schools in the world. I also started supporting students in South Florida and eventually around the country in their academic endeavors as a [private tutor](/tutor), which I enjoy even far past the 20,000-hour mark.

In July 2022, I moved to beautiful Spokane, WA with the talented, lovely [Sam Wilder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samantha-lynn-wilder/) to explore another part of the country. So far, so great! üèîÔ∏èüå≤
