From the [Project Euler website](https://projecteuler.net/):

> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

I submitted my first solution to Project Euler in 2015, and I've worked on them occasionally since then. Here's an up-to-date look at my progress:

As of {percentile_update}, that's good enough to put me in the top {percentile}% of solvers. But it's less about the global statistics and more about the fun of approaching problems from different angles and perspectives until you have that **aha!** moment.

I made this progress based more on my Computer Science skills than my Math background - though I did take a couple of pure math courses as a Statistics major, I'm hardly a beast when it comes to number theory. But I've definitely learned a few things solving these problems, and I'm sure I'll learn more as I continue to hack away at them!

If you're learning how to program, trying to learn a new programming language, or preparing for technical interviews, I highly recommend you check out [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net)!
