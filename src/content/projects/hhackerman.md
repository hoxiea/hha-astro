summary: In the summer of 2024, I decided to revamp my personal website. I wanted to make it more modern and accessible while learning more about web programming. I also wanted to make it easier to update and maintain. It's nothing too fancy, but I'm happy with the result!

This website is powered by a few technologies that I've enjoyed working with:

- [Astro](https://astro.build/), a static site generator that lets you use React, Vue, and Svelte components in Markdown files. The documentation is incredible, the command-line interface is one of the best I've ever seen, the performance of the resulting pages is awesome, and it just works.

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework that makes styling a breeze. (Fun fact: The design of this website was actually inspired partly by [Adam Wathan's site](https://adamwathan.me/). Adam created Tailwind, among other things.)

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), a superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language. I've been using TypeScript for a few years now, and I love how it catches bugs at compile time and makes refactoring a breeze.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/), a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I've been using React for a few years now, and I love how it lets you create reusable components and manage state in a declarative way. That said, Astro components get you a lot of the way there without needing React.

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a platform that makes it easy to deploy and manage static sites. hhackerman.com used to be a standard GitHub Pages site, but Netlify has been a huge upgrade in terms of ease of use and functionality. Its free tier is more than good enough for this site.

- [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for most of the content. I've been using Markdown for years, and it's great to be able to use it for my personal site as well.

This won't be the last project that I use this tech stack for!
